          <p><h5>Dudhsagar Waterfall</h5></p>
          <p>Dudhsagar literally means 'sea of milk'. Perched on the lofty heights of the Western Ghats and falling from 600 metres, Dudhsagar is the 5th highest waterfall in India.  Legend has it that the King’s daughter went to bathe at the falls, when a prince appeared.  Immediately, the virtuous and modest princess poured sugared milk into the pond to shield her body from the glances of the stranger.  To this day, it is believed that this milk flows down the mountain in torrents.</p>

          <p>Built by the Portuguese in 1612 to defend Goa's coastline, it is ideally situated at the mouth of the Mandovi River. The fort was used as a watering station by ships after a long voyage. The four-storey lighthouse situated here was assembled in 1864 and is the oldest in Asia.  It was one of the four forts namely Cabo, Gaspar Dias, Reis Magos and Aguada that served as sentinels against attacks from invaders via the sea. The Gaspar Dias fort no longer exists, Cabo is now the Governor's Palace and Reis Magos is under renovation.</p>

While angling in Goa, one can come across many interesting varieties of fish these include; salmon, mullet, catfish, rockfish, stingray, guitarfish and the local barramundi.</p>
