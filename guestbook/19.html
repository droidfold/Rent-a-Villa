                 <p> We all throughly enjoyed the 3 day stay at the villa. The villa was clean, spacious and very much like home. The well-furnished kitchen was something we all enjoyed. As our days started with nice heavy breakfasts. The garden around and beach chairs outside were great to sit out and walk in during the cool nights. A special thanks to you. Rosie was very efficient with her work too. Thanks a million for the lovely stay. Looking forward to many more holidays at your villa.</p>

                 <p> Villa is beautiful and sublime and unique quietly ..<br />
Rooms spacious and clean and all services are available and arranged garden<br />
Very close to the beach ..<br />
I advise the groups consisting of 4-7 in the villa housing because they find it more economical and comfortable with full privacy</p>

                 <p> We spent our holiday at Villa Calangute, we have been to Goa many times but really enjoyed this stay. The owners were really friendly and helpful and helped us source out all the bargains. The rooms were clean, tidy and had all the modern facilities and most importantly reasonably priced. The villa was close to all the hot spots and only two minutes away from Calangute beach. When we arrived we got a welcome pack so didn't need to head straight to the shops for supplies.</p>

                 <p> We did have a wonder holiday would like to thank Dexter and Leayana for the perfect hospitality during our stay there. The rooms were very clean and upscale, perfect for us. We will be returning customers in the near future, and will give high recommendations to our peers. If we go to Goa again, it will definitely be Villa Calangute!<br />
Cheers !!!</p>

                 <p> We were two families with small kids & had a wonderfull stay.Mrs & Mr Desouza took personal care right from check in till check out to make our stay a memorable one.The best part is that Villa Calangute has all ameneties that one looks for in a hotel or a resort.Morover it is 2 mintues walk from the beach so one can make frequent trips to the beach.It is ideally located as all prime beaches are 5-10kms from Villa Calangute.</p>

                 <p> Had a fabulous time in Goa, the residence was supperb, we were looked after very well by our hosts, the accomodation was very clean and comfortable. If I had to pick a fault, it would be that the down stairs living room needs a airconditioner.</p>

				 </p>
                 <p> One of my best experience ever. I was on a trip to Goa with friends and was looking for a place to live where we could feel at home, not because we wanted to but also because we had our best with us our dogs. when i spoke to dexter, he was more than happy to welcome us in our house. It is just 2 mins from Calangute Beach and we had a gala of a time. <br />
The house help "Priya" also was very good and ensured the place was kept clean and tidy. it felt we had the housekeeping of a five star hotel. <br />
We all wish Villa Calangute the best of luck for its future and hope to see Dexter and Leyana very soon. We now plan to stay at only his property every time we visit.<br />
We rate the property 5 ***</p>

Nice self content and well equipped villa. Just 5 minutes walk to the Calangute beach. We loved every bit of it. Rooms were also very clean and well maintained. Any thing you need is just round the corner also the Villa provides all the necessary contact details like bike / taxi rentals etc. Overall we were very happy, relaxed and enjoyed every bit of it.</p>

Our stay here has been very pleasureable and hope to come back to this villa in the very near future.  This time with my grandchildren who will enjoy the benefits of the beach not even 5 minutes walk away from here.  I will definitely recommend this place to my friends and family.<br />
<br />
Thanking you again for our easy stay.</p>

Would certainly love to stay here again while in Goa.  Thanks again, and all the best, hope to see you both in Australia one day!!</p>

We were really impressed when we received your call at 12pm on our check in day, enquiring and helping us find the place.  This place is great value for money.  Thank you very much, we will surely visit again next time and will surely visit again next time and will also refer our friends and family.  <br />

Also, we would be glad to recommend this place to our friends.  The surprise package of eggs, beer, milk and other grocery items came handy.  Moveover, we all loved the deco inside the house.  Hoping to continue the association with you.  Just one suggestion, if we may - doormats would really help after a bath and more drinking water too!  All in all, it was a very exciting stay for us.<br />

<br />
The house ist great. Everything is like you promise in the net. We can recommend your house to all travellers to Goa.<br />
<br />
It is quiet and if you wish to make party, just walk a few minutes and you find the party. If you like it quiet, just stay in the area arround the villa.<br />
<br />
The beach ist just 3 minutes by foot.<br />
<br />
All in all: You give us great holidays. Hope to see you again.<br />

The Villa was as advertised on the net.<br />
The Villa was Clean, an important issue with us.<br />
We would like to have internet access in the villa (at a cost of course),<br />
However, we were aware of this not being available on making the booking.<br />
All said, we would be happy to stay at the Villa Calangute again.<br />
