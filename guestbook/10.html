                 <p> I've been going to Goa for years and have lived all over (including my own property there). As there were 6 of us travelling, we came across Villa Calangute online and decided to try it.<br />
<br />
They use a simple and straightforward booking system which is very transparent and helpful. The option of having a shopping list ready for you when you arrive is an added convenience.<br />
<br />
Lucinda got in touch with us before we arrived and was available to guide us to the Villa once we landed in Goa. Check in and 'orientation' (where she explained the basic functioning of the villa) were a breeze and handled well. We had a housekeeper (Roseann) present daily from 9am to 5pm and she was very courteous and unobtrusive, not to mention really helpful.<br />
<br />
The villa itself (we stayed in Phase 4) was immaculate, clean and welcoming. Tastefully decorated and very comfortable. We met with Dexter at the start and the end of our stay - his hospitable nature is clearly evident and directly linked to the experience provided.<br />
<br />
Our holiday was a great de-stresser overall and Villa Calangute played a central role in that. I would most definitely be staying with them again and would highly recommend them to anyone planning a visit to Goa. </p>

                 <p> hi<br />
the service provided by villa calangute was very helpfull, the staff was very friendly!<br />
during our stay we had no problems whatsoever<br />
the location is quite accessible to baga and calangute, supermarket is close by and many good eateries around.<br />
it was a safe place.. we were a group of 10 girls .. so safety was our concerned issue.<br />
it is a fully equipped self catered vila.. all the amenities were good.<br />
We had trouble operating the washing machine<br />
& it would be great if the was an a/c in the hall or at least a cooler .. </p>

                 <p> I stayed here with friends for a month and the villa was great, very big spacious and spotless, the location is perfect for the beach and there are plenty of bars and eating places...We got the people from the new bar across the road bringing our food and drink to us and soon became like locals in the area. The villa could not be faulted in any way and all we had to do was relax and enjoy the sunshine. </p>

										 &nbsp; One Of The Best Decisions Made During My Trip To Goa... Excellen					</h4>
													
				 <p>
				 <i><small>Review posted on <strong>TripAdvisor.co.uk</strong> on  22/04/2013 for a stay in April 2013</small></i>
				 </p>
                 <p> I am glad to write a review on Villa Calangute.<br />
<br />
I was in Goa with a large group (8 adults and 4 kids) from april 18th to 21st.<br />
<br />
This was the best decisions made during my trip to Goa. Staying at the Villa was an "awesome" experience.<br />
<br />
Dexter and his team has maintained this villa in a great way. Spot clean, well maintained, great location, generous staff, excellent owner.<br />
<br />
Having a private villa for your family and group members is an excellent experience. On top of this Dexter and his team took real good care of us during our stay in Goa. They were very helpful, were able to reach whenever we needed their help and very courteous.<br />
<br />
This place is close to the Calangute beach (hardly a walk of about 5 mins) and also close to many other grocery stores / restaurants to help you have a good time in Goa.<br />
<br />
I would really suggest that if you plan to be in Goa with a group, please do not miss an excellent opportunity to stay at Villa Calangute.<br />
<br />
Me and my friends have already decided that everytime we come to Goa as a group Villa Calangute is going to be our place to stay.<br />
<br />
Dexter I would like to thank you and your whole staff for helping us make this a wonderful and memorable trip.<br />
<br />
You all are great. </p>

                 <p> The stay was great, The owners were wonderful and very helpful. If we had a problem they were there to assist straight away. The Maids in both houses were wonderful great service from them, very helpful and kept the place clean and tidy. The house is a tad different to the western standard of housing but for India this place is great. Location is amazing very close to the beach and resturants. Money exchanges in every corner. Overall wonderful experience, very accomodating and lovely facilities. </p>

The villa was located very close to the main street within walking distance yet tucked away in an area that is quiet and not noisy. The area was safe and easy to get to with good security and lighting around the streets. The villa is very spacious with plenty of rooms, an upstairs seating area in addition to the spacious living room/dinner area. Everything was clean and tidy with hot water, sky tv, air conditioning and wifi facilities. It was a perfect place to stay and would definitely recommend to anyone that visits Goa and wants to have a good time.</p>
