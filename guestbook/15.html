				 </p>
                 <p> Villa Calangute really lived upto it's promise and served as an ideal place to celebrate my mother's 75th birthday.<br />
The property is well maintained and professionally managed. The housekeeper also helped out with the cooking which was very good.<br />
The standard of hygiene is very good. Being the monsoon season the mosquitoes & flies we're an irritant.<br />
The owner was eager to offer tips for bettering the holiday.<br />
The management I felt was a llittle too stringent with the rules. We had originally booked for 10 persons though 8 turned up we still ended up paying for 10 which I felt was too rigid for hospitality business and a disadvantage for making booking well in advance.</p>

The gestures cannot be expressed in words ever. Thanks a Lott for everything. And we will keep coming back . </p>

                 <p> We stayed at Villa Calangute Phase 1 bungalow for 3 nights. the bungalow is maintained in a very good condition and is very clean and neat. garden is also very well maintained has a hammock and sunbeds too...kitchen is well equipped and we were provided teabags sugar coffee milk eggs bread butter coldrinks which were complimentary which we highly appreciated. Bedrooms are also cosy. bathrooms are clean just that the housekeeper should try to keep it dry after cleaning it. also face towels should be provided. location of the bungalow is very nice just 2 mins walk and u reach the beach..lots of restaurants and shopping within hands reach...great for families and friends...highly recommended... </p>

                 <p> Be it morning, noon or night, there was this pleasant privacy always there. The cleanliness and peace of mind can take over any thought in your mind. I expected average, but for sure, this is beyond ones expectation.<br />
<br />
I hope you choose this place without a second thought, it will for sure be a pleasant stay as it was for me. </p>

I would only suggest that a shower curtian be provided between the shower and the toilet/wash basin </p>

The villa was located very close to the main street within walking distance yet tucked away in an area that is quiet and not noisy. The area was safe and easy to get to with good security and lighting around the streets. The villa is very spacious with plenty of rooms, an upstairs seating area in addition to the spacious living room/dinner area. Everything was clean and tidy with hot water, sky tv, air conditioning and wifi facilities. It was a perfect place to stay and would definitely recommend to anyone that visits Goa and wants to have a good time.</p>

Our stay here has been very pleasureable and hope to come back to this villa in the very near future.  This time with my grandchildren who will enjoy the benefits of the beach not even 5 minutes walk away from here.  I will definitely recommend this place to my friends and family.<br />
<br />
Thanking you again for our easy stay.</p>

We were really impressed when we received your call at 12pm on our check in day, enquiring and helping us find the place.  This place is great value for money.  Thank you very much, we will surely visit again next time and will surely visit again next time and will also refer our friends and family.  <br />

Also, we would be glad to recommend this place to our friends.  The surprise package of eggs, beer, milk and other grocery items came handy.  Moveover, we all loved the deco inside the house.  Hoping to continue the association with you.  Just one suggestion, if we may - doormats would really help after a bath and more drinking water too!  All in all, it was a very exciting stay for us.<br />

<br />
The house ist great. Everything is like you promise in the net. We can recommend your house to all travellers to Goa.<br />
<br />
It is quiet and if you wish to make party, just walk a few minutes and you find the party. If you like it quiet, just stay in the area arround the villa.<br />
<br />
The beach ist just 3 minutes by foot.<br />
<br />
All in all: You give us great holidays. Hope to see you again.<br />

The Villa was as advertised on the net.<br />
The Villa was Clean, an important issue with us.<br />
We would like to have internet access in the villa (at a cost of course),<br />
However, we were aware of this not being available on making the booking.<br />
All said, we would be happy to stay at the Villa Calangute again.<br />
