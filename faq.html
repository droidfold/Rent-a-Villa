                          NO. It’s not possible. Once the booking is confirmed for 'X' number of people, no reduction in the price will be accepted if the number of individuals decreases. WHY? Firstly we give preference to bookings with a higher number of guests. Secondly, if you book a hotel which is based on double occupancy (like our rooms are) and you cancel the room booking, you would not receive any refund. We follow the same policy.

Please note upon check out we need the villa retuned to us in the same condition it was given to you so we can provide the same service for the next guest. If any item is broken/ damaged the guest has to pay for the item. If any linen/ towels are stained, we request the guest to either clean the stains before checkout or pay us the full price of a new towel.

These items will be kept at the villa on your day of arrival. You just have to pay the market price for the items.

For the other days during your stay you can ask the housekeeper to assist you will shopping and pay the housekeeper directly for the item and service depending on what is requested.

                          A. 80% of hotels and guest houses have a standard check in time at 12pm and check out at 10am. We also strictly follow the same rule. By deviating from these timings, we are blocking a potential booking for the next/ previous day which can affect our business. We want all transitions of checkins/ checkouts to be smooth so please accept this timing before you confirm the booking.

                          An extra cost of INR 5,000 per hour is applicable for checkouts not done by 10am. This is to ensure that the next guests are not kept waiting at the gate while you have exceed your time limit of checkout. We are very strict on this as we have made it clear to you from day one.

If any damages are done to the wall we will charge you full price towards fixing + one full day's rent + service charges + our time spent repairing it.

We request you not to smoke in the villa as it will take one hour to put off the loud buzzing sound of the alarm once it goes ON. We have large galleries/garden space where you can enjoy smoking your lungs to glory.

                          A. <i>(The Navhind Times Thursday, January 23rd 2014) : Panjim:</i>
                          Mumbai: Currency notes issued before 2005 will be completely withdrawn from circulation by the end of the current financial year ending Mar. 31. the Reserve Bank of India said Wednesday. The central bank said from April 1, 2014, public would be required to approach banks for exchanging this notes until further communication to banks. The central bank stated that public can easily identify the notes to be withdrawn as those issued before 2005 do not have the year of printing on their reverse side. The Reserve bank also clarified that the notes issued before 2005 will continue to be legal tender. This would mean that banks are required to exchange the notes for their customers as well as for non-customers from July 1, 2014, however to exchange more than 10 notes of Rs.500 and Rs. 1000 will have to furnish proof of identity and residence to the bank branch in which she/he wants to exchange the notes. “The reserve bank has appealed to the public not to panic. They are requested to actively cooperate in the withdrawal process.”

                        <p>Holiday makers are looking for different and flexible holidays. Peace, quiet and relaxation are priceless commodities, especially on your holidays. When you want to completely relax and get far away from the crowds there’s really only one choice a private holiday villa. With no noisy neighbours, holiday reps or room service to contend with, relaxation is total and your options unlimited. In comparison, the all-inclusive resorts are noisy and impersonal. Hotels are very limiting and crowded. Holiday villas on the other hand offer flexibility, a better lifestyle, value for money and more enjoyable holidays.</p>
                        <p>Imagine a family of four, two adults and two children, staying together in a hotel room. Two double beds with little room between them, a small balcony and just one bathroom. Sounds like a relaxing holiday?Now imagine the same family staying in a villa with a private pool, with two, three or four bedrooms, a full kitchen, separate private bathrooms, large living areas, balconies and terraces. It’s a home from home with all the comforts you’d expect – and all the elements for a relaxing holiday.</p>
                        <p>The increasing popularity of low cost airlines has enabled flights to become cheaper than ever, making holiday villa rentals a popular and practical alternative to package holidays. Below are some of the advantages of renting a holiday villa with a private swimming pool:</p>
                        <p><strong>Top reasons to rent a holiday villa rather than stay in a hotel room</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                          <li>A holiday villa is much larger than a hotel room. We have 3 or 4 or 7 or 9 bedrooms villa’s with separate rooms. A living room and dining rooms provide a space to share and space to be yourself, this all adds up to a relaxing holiday.</li>
                          <li>Holiday villas are cheaper considering the space and amenities available, holiday villas offer great value for money.</li>
                          <li>We provide a fully equipped kitchen which is considerably cheaper than eating out. Don’t fancy cooking? At Villa Calangute you have the freedom to order takeaway meals to enjoy at your leisure. The villa’s information books usually list all the local choices.
